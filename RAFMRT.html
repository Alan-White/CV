<h2>RAF Leuchars Mountain Rescue Team, January 1991 - September 1993</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Novice</b>.  After a three week trial I was accepted into the team as a novice.  Single novices were expected to attend three training weekends out of four and Monday night briefings.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>RAF Mountain Rescue Winter Course</b>, February 1992.  Two weeks winter climbing and navigation in the Ben Nevis and Cairngorm areas.</li>
        <li><b>RAF Mountain Rescue Summer Course</b>, July 1992.  Two weeks rock climbing and ropework training in North Wales.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>Trained</b>, September 1992.  After many weekends on the hills I was promoted to become a trained team member.  This allowed me to lead groups on the hills during training.</li>
    <li><b>Party Leader</b>.  Shortly before leaving the team to study for university, I was offered the chance to do party leader assessment.  This recognised my training, experience and progress and would have allowed me to lead a group during a rescue.</li>
  </ul>
