<h2>Youth Expedition Leader</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Peru 2006</b>: Voluntary position as a mountain leader with BSES Expeditions.  During this seven week expedition I led a group of ten teenagers for six weeks in a remote mountainous area.  We trekked on snow and ice up to 5500m.  We also assisted scientists conducting ornithology research.</li>
    <li><b>Kyrgyzstan 1999</b>: Voluntary position as a geologist/mountain leader with BSES Expeditions.  During this seven week expedition I organised a geology mapping project for twelve teenagers and co-led a trek up the Inylcheck Glacier to the base camp for Kahn Tengri.  The other leader became ill and we had to arrange a helicopter rescue.</li> 
    <li><b>India 1997</b>: Voluntary position as an expedition leader with World Challenge Expeditions.  During this four week expedition I led a group of twelve teenage schoolgirls on a trek which involved snow and ice at 4,750m.  We also met local children and painted their primary school.</li>
