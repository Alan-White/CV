<h2>Rope access technician (abseiler) and non-destructive tester (inspector)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Abseiler/inspector</b>.  Between 1999 and 2016 I was working mainly in the offshore oil and gas industry.  I was subcontracted by larger companies to supervise and carry out inspection work on pipelines and structures.
I was a level 3 rope access supervisor and was responsible for a team of three or four abseilers carrying out work at height on oil platforms offshore or on bridges etc onshore.  I assessed the worksite, completed a written rescue plan, brief the team and ensured the work is carried out safely.  This often involved liaising with a control room and rescue boat via radio.  If a rescue had been necessary, I would have completed the rescue myself or directed the other team members.</li>
    <li><b>Abseiler</b>.  I passed the level 2 course in 2000 and the level 3 course in 2003.  After which I was leading teams on various jobs around the world.</li>
    <li><b>Inspector</b>. I was qualified in ultrasonic, magnetic particle and dye penetrant inspection methods.  I was also qualified to assist a radiographer.</li>
    <li><b>Places worked</b>: North Sea (Offshore Holland and Scotland), Caspian Sea (offshore Azerbaijan), Gulf of Mexico (offshore Texas), Louisiana, Atlantic (onboard a tanker from North Carolina to Virgin Islands), Norway, Angola (offshore), Mediteranean (offshore Spain) and France.</li>
